# 🚀 Airlline Fare Prediction using Machine Learning! 📊
* Ever wondered how airlines price their tickets? 🤔💰 Using Machine Learning, I built a Flight Fare Predictor that helps estimate ticket prices based on multiple factors like airline, stops, duration, and travel date! 🛫

### 🔍 Here’s how I did it:

## ✅ Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering:

* Handled missing values to clean the dataset 🧼
* Converted travel dates into Journey_day & Journey_month 📆
* Extracted departure & arrival times for better insights ⏳
* Transformed categorical data using One-Hot Encoding 🏷️

## ✅ Modeling & Prediction:

* Implemented Random Forest Regressor 🌲 for accurate fare predictions
* Tuned hyperparameters for better performance 🎯
* Split data into training & test sets to evaluate results

## ✅ Evaluation Metrics:

* Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and RMSE used for accuracy check 📉

## 📊 Results:
* ✔️ The model provides reliable fare predictions based on real-world data ✈️
* ✔️ Helps travelers and airlines optimize ticket pricing strategies! 💰

##💡 Why is this important?

* Helps passengers book at the right time for the best prices 🔍
* Enables airlines to analyze fare trends 📊
* Proves how AI is transforming the travel industry! 🤖
